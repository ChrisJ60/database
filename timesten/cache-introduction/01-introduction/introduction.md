# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop you will discover how deploying Oracle TimesIen In-Memory Database as an in-memory relational cache for Oracle Database can dramatically improve the resposne times for SQL queries, typically by an order of magnitude.

Setting up a TimesTen cache is quick and easy. This workshop leads you through the process step by step and uses both a simple OLTP application and sample queries to demonstrate the incredibly low query latencies provided by TimesTen.

Estimated Workshop Time: 60 minutes.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Start up the components required for the labs
* Create a TimesTen instance
* Execute some basic TimesTen commands
* Prepare the Oracle database for TimesTen caching
* Prepare a TimesTen datbase and set it up as a cache
* Load data from the Oracle database into the cached tables and activate cache refresh
* Verify cache refresh
* Run a simple OLTP benchmark to see the performance benefit of TimesTen
* Run some queries to see the speedup provided by TimesTen
* Use dynamic cache groups
* Shutdown the TimesTen cache and instance

### Prerequisites

This workshop assumes that you have:

* Some familiarity with Oracle Database
* A basic understanding of SQL

In order to run this workshop you need either:

* An Oracle Cloud account with sufficient available resources in your tenancy, if you wish to run the workshop in your own tenancy. This workshop does _not_ support the Oracle Cloud 'Always Free' tier due to that tier's resource restrictions.
* An Oracle Account, if you want to ruin the workshop in the LiveLabs sandbox.

You may now ***proceed to the next lab***.
