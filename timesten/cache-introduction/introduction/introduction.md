# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop you will discover how deploying Oracle Timesten In-Memory Database as an in-memory relational cache for Oracle Database can dramatically improve the resposne times for SQL queries, typically by an order of magnitude.

Setting up a TimesTen cache is quick and easy. This workshop leads you through the process step by step and uses both a simple OLTP application and sample queries to demonstrate the incredibly low query latencies provided by TimesTen.

Estimated Workshop Time: 45-60 minutes (This estimate is for the entire workshop - it is the sum of the estimates provided for each of the labs included in the workshop.)


### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Start up the components required for the labs
* Install TimesTen and create a TimesTen instance
* Execute some basic TimesTen commands
* Prepare the Oracle database for TimesTen caching
* Prepare a TimesTen datbase and set it up as a cache
* Load data from the Oracle database into the cached tables and activate automatic change propagation
* Verify automatic change propagation
* Run a simple OLTP benchmark to see the performance benefit of TimesTen
* Run some sample queries to see the speedup delivered by TimesTen
* Explore TimesTen's PassThrough feature
* Use dynamic cache groups
* Shutdown the TimesTen cache and instance

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* A basic knowledge of relational databases, ideally Oracle Database
* A basic understanding of SQL
